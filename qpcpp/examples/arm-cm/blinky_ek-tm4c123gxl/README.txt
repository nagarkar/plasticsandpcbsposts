About this Example
==================
This directory contains the simple "Blinky" QP example application for
the EK-TM4C123GXL board (TivaC LauchPad) with the preemptive QK kernel.
This directory contains portable code that should compile with any C
compiler for ARM Cortex-M.

The sub-directories contain code and project files, which are specific
to the particular ARM toolchains, such as ARM (MDK-ARM), GNU, and IAR.

Please refer to the README files in the sub-directories for specific
instructions how to use and customize the example to your needs.


Support Code for EK-TM4C123GXL Board 
====================================
The directory qpc\3rd_party\ek-tm4c123gxl contains the CMSIS-compliant
device code for the TM4C123GH6PM MCU. Please see the README.txt file in
this folder for more details.


QS Software Tracing Instrumentation
===================================
This example provides the "Spy" build configuration, which outputs the QS
(Quantum Spy) software tracing data through UART0, which is connected to
the virtual COM port of the TI Stellaris debugger.

The output is generated at 115200 baud rate.

Here is an example invocation of the QSPY host application to receive
the QS data from EK-TM4C123GXL:

qspy -cCOM1

The actual COM port number might be different on your Windows machine.
Please check the Device Manager to find the COM port number.
