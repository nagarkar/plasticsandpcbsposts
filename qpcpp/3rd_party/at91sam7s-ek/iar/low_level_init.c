* __low_level_init() is invoked by the standard IAR startup sequence after
* cstartup, but before initializing the segments in RAM. The function
* gives the application a chance to perform early initializations of
* the hardware. This function cannot use any static variables, because these
* have not yet been initialized in RAM.
*
* The value returned by __low_level_init() determines whether or not data
* segments should be initialized by __seqment_init. If __low_level_init()
* returns 0, the data segments will NOT be initialized. For more information
* see the "IAR ARM C/C++ Compiler Reference Guide".
